# TeamCapacityBalancing
This project serves as a valuable tool for a team leader to efficiently allocate tasks across team members, leveraging Jira as a foundation. It offers the capability to assess resource allocation not only in the short term, spanning a few sprints, but also over the entire duration of a release. The application empowers users to import epics and stories directly from Jira's database, apply filters according to internal conventions, establish team configurations, define a release schedule, outline short-term objectives, visualize resource allocation for both short and long-term perspectives, save local data, and seamlessly refresh stories from Jira.
